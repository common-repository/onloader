A shortcode for loading content via AJAX on page load with a spinning load indicator.

== Description ==

This shortcode, `onloader`, makes it possible to dynamically load extra content onto a page, with a nice spinning
load indicator taking the place of the content until it is loaded.

= Usage =

Add a shortcode like the following to the content of a post or page.

`[onloader href="..." id="..." width="..." height="..." style="..."]`

The `href` attribute is mandatory, the rest are optional.

Attribute descriptions:

* **href**: The URL of the the content that should be loaded and displayed (or a string beginning with "demo").
* **id**: Used to differentiate between several otherwise identical shortcodes on a single page. Should be a simple
text string beginning with a letter.
* **width**: The width of the box that will hold the load indicator and the content once it is loaded, expressed as
CSS, e.g. `200px` or `100%`. The default value is `100%`.
* **height**: The height of the box that will hold the load indicator and the content once it is loaded, expressed as
CSS, e.g. `200px` or `100%`. The default value is `200px`.
* **style**: CSS to style the box that holds the content, e.g. `text-align: center; color: red`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get a JavaScript error, "Access to restricted URI denied" =

Because of the browser/JavaScript security model, it is not possible to load content from other sites, only
from the same domain the OnLoad'er script itself is located on.

A proxy service will be added to a later version of the plugin.

= How can I test that it works? =

Add the shortcode `[onloader href="demo"]` to a page, and hit preview. You should see the spinning load indicator,
and after a few seconds the message "You are seeing the output of the OnLoad'er demo script. Everything worked!".

= Can I use more than one on a single page =

Certainly. If you are loading content from distinct URLs, it should "just work", otherwise add `id` attributes
with suitable values to make it possible to tell them apart.

= Another question? =

If your question isn't answered here, please do leave a comment in the forum or on the plugin's homepage:
